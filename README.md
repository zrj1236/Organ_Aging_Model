# Organ-Specific Aging Prediction Using Proteomic Data
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating models that predict organ-specific aging using proteomic data. The models are developed using nested cross-validation.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict organ-specific aging from proteomic data collected from healthy individuals. The models utilize organ-enriched proteins and include sex as a covariate. The methodology employs nested cross-validation for unbiased model performance assessment and hyperparameter optimization.

## Requirements
Python = 3.13.5
xgboost = 3.0.3
scikit-learn = 1.7.1
numpy  = 2.3.2
scipy  =  1.16.1
pandas  = 2.3.1
