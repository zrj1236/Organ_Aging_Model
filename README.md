#Organ-Specific Aging Prediction Using Proteomic Data
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating models that predict organ-specific aging using proteomic data. The models are developed using nested cross-validation and validated on an independent dataset to ensure robustness and generalization performance.

##Overview
The goal of this project is to predict organ-specific aging from proteomic data collected from healthy individuals. The models utilize organ-enriched proteins and include sex as a covariate. The methodology employs nested cross-validation for unbiased model performance assessment and hyperparameter optimization.
